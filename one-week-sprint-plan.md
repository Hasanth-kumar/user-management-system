ðŸ“… 1-Week Sprint Plan for User Management System
Goal: Build a working microservice-based User Management System in 7 days using ChatGPT for code generation and MongoDB for data storage. Focus on functionality first, then learn deeply later.

âœ… Summary
Duration	6â€“7 Days (6â€“8 focused hours per day)
Services	auth-service, user-service, email-service
Tools	Spring Boot, MongoDB Atlas/local, JWT, REST
Excluded	Docker, API Gateway, RabbitMQ, Swagger, CI/CD

ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites
Before starting:

Have Java 17+, Maven, MongoDB (local or Atlas), and IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or VS Code) ready.

Install Postman for API testing.

Create 3 Spring Boot projects (auth-service, user-service, email-service) using Spring Initializr.

ðŸ“† Daily Plan
Day 1 â€“ Project Setup + user-service (CRUD)
âœ… Scaffold all 3 projects (auth, user, email) via Spring Initializr.

âœ… Add MongoDB connection in user-service.

âœ… Create UserProfile model, repository, service, controller.

âœ… Implement full CRUD: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for /api/users.

âœ… Test endpoints via Postman.

ðŸ‘‰ Focus: Spring Boot structure, REST APIs, MongoDB with Spring Data.

Day 2 â€“ auth-service (Login + Register + JWT)
âœ… Add MongoDB connection to auth-service.

âœ… Create UserAuth model with hashed password (BCrypt).

âœ… Implement POST /api/auth/register and POST /api/auth/login.

âœ… Integrate JWT token generation using io.jsonwebtoken.

âœ… Return JWT on login.

ðŸ‘‰ Focus: Authentication logic, token generation, password hashing.

Day 3 â€“ JWT Authorization + Protect Endpoints
âœ… Secure user-service endpoints with Spring Security filters.

âœ… Add JWT filter to validate token from Authorization: Bearer header.

âœ… Restrict certain routes to authenticated users only.

âœ… Use a test JWT to confirm protection.

ðŸ‘‰ Focus: Authorization, security filters, Spring Security basics.

Day 4 â€“ email-service (Send Email via REST)
âœ… Connect email-service to MongoDB (for email logs).

âœ… Configure SMTP (use Mailtrap.io for testing).

âœ… Create /api/emails/send endpoint.

âœ… From auth-service, call this endpoint after registration using WebClient.

ðŸ‘‰ Focus: Inter-service communication, sending emails.

Day 5 â€“ Integration & End-to-End Flow
âœ… Test full flow: Register user â†’ JWT generated â†’ profile created â†’ email sent.

âœ… Implement error handling (user exists, invalid login, etc.).

âœ… Add CORS configuration where needed.

âœ… Save email logs in email-service.

ðŸ‘‰ Focus: Full working system, test and stabilize.

Day 6 â€“ Refactoring & Learning Pass
âœ… Go through generated code and ask ChatGPT for explanations.

âœ… Add comments in the code to document your understanding.

âœ… Polish code structure, organize folders.

âœ… Add meaningful responses/messages from APIs.

ðŸ‘‰ Focus: Learn from the code you built.

Day 7 â€“ README + Manual Deployment
âœ… Write final README.md with instructions.

âœ… Clean up config files (like application.properties).

âœ… Prepare GitHub repo (optional).

âœ… If time permits, start planning enhancements (Docker, Swagger, etc.).

ðŸ‘‰ Focus: Documentation, polish, and prepare for real-world usage.

âœ… Daily Output Checklist
Day	Output
Day 1	Functional user-service with full CRUD
Day 2	Functional auth-service with JWT token generation
Day 3	JWT-based protection in user-service
Day 4	Functional email-service, integrated with auth-service
Day 5	Fully integrated system tested end-to-end
Day 6	Code review, refactor, and concept reinforcement
Day 7	Final doc, cleanup, and GitHub-ready repo

ðŸ§  Tips for Staying Efficient
Keep ChatGPT open for fast debugging.

Test every feature immediately after implementation.

Save common code snippets for reuse (e.g., JWT utility class).

Donâ€™t dive too deep into theory during the sprint â€” focus on completion first.
