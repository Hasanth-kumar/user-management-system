// This is the main entry point for the Auth Service application.
// It uses Spring Boot's @SpringBootApplication annotation to enable auto-configuration, component scanning, and configuration properties.
// The main method starts the application by calling SpringApplication.run() with the AuthServiceApplication class and command-line arguments.
// This application will handle user authentication, including login and token generation.
// It will also provide JWT token validation for other services like User Service.
// The Auth Service will be responsible for generating JWT tokens upon successful login and validating these tokens in subsequent requests.
// The JWT token will be used to authenticate requests to the User Service and other services that require user authentication.
// The Auth Service will also manage user credentials and provide endpoints for user registration and login.
// The application will be configured to use a shared secret key for JWT signing and validation, which should match the key used in the User Service.
// The Auth Service will also handle user roles and permissions, allowing for role-based access control in the User Service and other services.
// The application will be structured to follow best practices for security, including secure password storage, token expiration, and refresh mechanisms.
// The Auth Service will expose RESTful endpoints for user authentication, such as /login and /register.
// It will also provide endpoints for token validation and user profile management.
// The application will be designed to be stateless, meaning that it will not store user sessions on the server side.
// Instead, it will rely on JWT tokens for maintaining user authentication state across requests.
// The Auth Service will be deployed as a separate microservice, allowing for independent scaling and management.
// It will communicate with the User Service and other services via HTTP requests, passing JWT tokens in the Authorization header for authentication.
// The application will be configured to use Spring Security for securing endpoints and managing authentication.
// The Auth Service will also include exception handling for authentication errors, such as invalid credentials or expired tokens.
// The application will be tested to ensure that it correctly handles user authentication, token generation, and validation.
// The Auth Service will be monitored for security vulnerabilities and performance issues, ensuring that it remains robust and secure.
// The application will be documented to provide clear guidelines for developers on how to use the Auth Service and integrate it with other services.
